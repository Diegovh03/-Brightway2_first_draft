# -Brightway2_first_draft
First Draft of LCA Visualization with Brightway2
This repository contains a simple example of visualizing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) results using Brightway2 along with Python and Matplotlib. In this example, we use Brightway2 to run a basic LCA on a simplified vanadium electrolyte production process and then visualize the contributions of various exchanges from the LCI (Life Cycle Inventory).
